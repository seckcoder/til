# Starting Index

Heap's starting index can be both 0 or 1. 

When starting from 0, you save one cell of memory. But it brings performance
pernalty. The reason is that when getting the parent of a node, you have to
check whether it equals 0. 

```cpp

#define PARENT(i) (((i)-1)>>1)

```

When `i` equals 0, i-1 will be negative value. When you set the index of node
as type unsigned, you will get unexpect result.
